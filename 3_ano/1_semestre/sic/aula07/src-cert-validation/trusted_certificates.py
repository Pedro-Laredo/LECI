    # Subjects are named with Distinguished Names (DN).
    # These are names that are sequences of attributes, similar to a teble row.
    #
    # Each attribute (or column in the table metaphore) is tagged with an OID (Object Identifier).
    # Object identifiers are semantic identifiers, that state what the attribute means.
    # For instance, 2.5.4.6 is CountryName (or C), 2.5.4.3 is CommonName (CN), etc.
    #
    # The RFC 4519 regulates the short names (such as C for CountryName and CN for CommonName), which are more user-friendly when
    # dealing with these names (as in RFC 4514).
    #
    # The usual way DNs are presented as a single string is as a continuous sequence of Identifier=Value pairs separated by slashes (/) or commas (,):
    #     /C=US/O-Digicert Inc/OU=www.digicert.com/CN=DigiCert Global Root CA
    #     C=US,O-Digicert Inc,OU=www.digicert.com,CN=DigiCert Global Root CA
